							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned that as a designer, the font of a text is very important as it is one of the ways on how designers can communicate with users. As a designer, we need to learn how to choose the appropriate typography to align it to its purpose. Each font sets a different purpose as it can set the mood and style of our design. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think my favorite part of the article is where the author simplifies ways on choosing the appropriate typography for a design. First, we would need to identify our audience, then we would need to look for font inspiration. The author also gives a few links to look for font inspirations which I think is very beneficial for designers. Lastly, we would need to pair our fonts with the appropriate size and also adapt to a styleguide to get designs that are similar to our own ways of designing. </p>
