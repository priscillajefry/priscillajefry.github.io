						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> From this article, I learned about the principles and rules for animating interfaces, particularly regarding the duration and speed of animations, the use of easing for more natural motion, and choreography in interface animations. The article highlights the importance of mimicking real-world movements and how animations should guide the user's attention effectively.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is the explanation of how different types of easing curves impact the feel of animations. It's fascinating to see how a subtle change in the curve can significantly influence the user's perception of the animation's realism and fluidity. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "If the animation is built correctly, then it is unobtrusive and does not distract the users from their goals. If it does, you either need to soften it or even remove it altogether. That means that the animation shouldnâ€™t slow down the user or prevent them from performing the task." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
