                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> Something I learned from this article is that it shows different designs of applications interfaces. It also shows me different animations of these interfaces. It makes me learn that there are many ways on how designs can be implemented on application interfaces. </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article is where the different uses of designs are put to design on different application interfaces.  </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I like the cryptocurrency transaction confirmation. The animations of this particular interface really matches the crypto vibe and also it shows how the transaction is going with the purple animation which really suits the theme of this particular design. </p>
