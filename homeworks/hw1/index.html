            From this article, I learned that even though people might not have an eye for design, by learning Kathleen's hack, we can all learn how to design. We can learn this by thinking as if we were the designer of a certain product.

            I think my favorite part of this article is how she broke down the things to keep in mind, such as how the design keeps me focused, the content of the design, the intent of a user and the audience of the product. I think by breaking it down into simple categories that are short and simple makes the reading so much easier and way more insightful.

            A quote from the article that I found interesting is "By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."

            On a scale of 1-10 I would rate it an 8 on how much I enjoyed reading this article.
